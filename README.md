14. Write a function that takes as an argument the value of the first and second elements of an arithmetic progression and returns the difference of this progression, the 15th element and the sum of its first 50 members.
15. Write a function that takes as an argument the value of the first and second element of a geometric progression and returns the denominator of this progression, the 15th element and the sum of its first 50 members.

## Dynamic arrays

1. Write a program that generates a dynamic array of all primes before N and displays them on the screen.
2. Write a program that, given a natural number n, prints all its prime natural divisors, taking into account the multiplicity. The running time of the program must be proportional to the root of n.
3. Given a number N. Form a dynamic array consisting of the first N Fibonacci numbers (recall that they are given by the recurrent formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, F1 = F2 = 1).
4. Given an array of integers, consisting of N elements. Fill it out from the keyboard. Count the number of odd elements before the minimum, if there are several of them, form a new array of them.
5. Given an array consisting of N elements and an array consisting of M elements. Fill them out from the keyboard. Create an array consisting of the positive elements of the input arrays.
6. Given an array consisting of N elements and an array consisting of M elements. Fill them out from the keyboard. Create an array consisting of even elements of the input arrays.
7. Given an array of N elements. Create a new array consisting of the positive elements of the input array.
8. Given an array of N elements. Create a new array consisting of the negative elements of the input array.
9. Given a dynamic array, the size of which is entered from the keyboard. Fill the array with random numbers. Remove K elements from it, starting from the middle of the array.
10. Write a program that creates a dynamic array and remove an element from the number N from it, add K elements, starting from the number N. N is entered from the keyboard
11. Given an array of integers, consisting of N elements. Fill it out from the keyboard. Create an array consisting of elements whose values are greater than the value of the previous element (starting from the second).
12. Given an array consisting of N elements and an array consisting of M elements. Fill them out from the keyboard. Find the minimum in the array N, and the maximum in the array M. Form an array consisting of N array elements preceding the minimum element and M array elements following the maximum.
13. Change the dynamic array of integers so that its positive elements become negative and vice versa.
14. Given an array consisting of N elements and an array consisting of M elements. Fill them in with random numbers. Create an array consisting of the positive elements of the N array and the negative elements of the M array.
15. Given an array consisting of N elements and an array consisting of M elements. Fill them in with random numbers. Create an array consisting of prime numbers of arrays N and M. The numbers in the new array cannot be repeated.
